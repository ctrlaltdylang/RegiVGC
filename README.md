## Details

Pokemon VGC Tournament Registration Platform created to learn more about Express and MongoDB.

As of July 2020, I have no plans to actually launch this platform, this was purely a learning experiment; but should a need arise, I will consider it.

Uses [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing node versions for multiple contributors.

Uses [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) as the hosted database, but you could also spin up and configure a MongoDB container with Docker.

Uses the following tools to lint & enforce code style:

- eslint
- prettier
- .editorconfig

## Debugging

To instart debugging, run `npm run debug` in the root directory of the project.
